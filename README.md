# Online Quiz Management System Project Laravel

Laravel’s Online Quiz and Test system is used to organize online multiple choice quizzes in educational institutions like as schools, colleges, and universities, as well as paid exam systems. Alternatively, the user might utilize it for a variety of examination reasons. You can’t utilize a questionnaire from another class right now. Hardened users may create a slew of accounts, complicating the teacher’s job. Either locate a server to host it on or host it locally. The response must be the same as the answer contained in questions to be correct in identification.
